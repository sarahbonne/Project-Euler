#If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

#I broke this down into 3 columns and 33 rows, each representing a group of 10.
#the first row and first column is summation of numbers under 10, which is 23.
#The first row and second column is the summation of multiples between 10 and 20, 55.
#The first row and third column is the summation of multiples between 20 and 30, 117.
#I discovered the first and third column rows worked as mulptiples of 150, and the second as multiples of 120.
#To find the summation, we simply multiply 150 or 120 by that row number, which goes from 0 to 32, and add 23, 55, or 117 depending on the column respectively.

n=0
i=32

while i>=0:
    item1=(i*150 + 23)
    item2=(i*120+55)
    item3=(i*150+117)
    n = n + item1 + item2 +item3
    i=i-1
    
#for multiples between 990 and 1000 we multiply 150 by 33 and add 23, then add that to our n counter.
#This is done seperately because the 2nd and 3rd columns would refer to numbers between 1000 and 1010, and 1010 and 1020.
n = n+ 4973
