If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
I broke this down into 3 columns and 33 rows, each representing a group of 10.
the first row and first column is summation of numbers under 10, which is 23.
The first row and second column is the summation of multiples between 10 and 20, 55.
The first row and third column is the summation of multiples between 20 and 30, 117.
I discovered the first and third column rows worked as mulptiples of 150, and the second as multiples of 120.
To find the summation, we simply multiply 150 or 120 by that row number, which goes from 0 to 32, and add 23, 55, or 117 depending on the column respectively.
